SUPER COOL ADVANCED WORLD
- action for descending a staircase
- action for moving from one chunk to another

- map chunks have a biome
- biomes extend down z-levels
- biome locations are hard-coded
- biomes determine parameters for procgen, tile colors

- some map chunks contain a hardcoded map
- create maps using Tiled editor?
- load tmx files using pytmx
- maybe store the entire world in a 3d .world file??


SCALING IT BACK A BIT
- more traditional dungeon-crawler style
- almost all procgen
- no up-stairs to prevent running around to shops and stuff
- biomes will still exist for z-levels and branches
- maybe use prefabs for some biomes
- maybe crawl-style dungeon branches?
    - branches are basically just another set of biomes that correspond to z-levels
    - special "branch staircase"
    - sets a current_branch variable

- start at the main level of toad hill
- descend deeper into the depths of the hill
- monsters live down there
- shopkeepers are there but they're total weirdos because they live in dangerous places
- there are some cave-like levels
- some ruin-like levels from ancient toad civilizations
- eventually you encounter towns like in nethack
